Test Assigment description:

### Front-end/Vue.js Test Assigment

This test is designed to evaluate general front-end skills, such as understanding of HTML elements and outline, principles of CSS cascade and SCSS structure, and JS/ES6+ skills. Furthermore it evaluates knowledge and skills in using Vue.js and related core plugins.

To make the setup and evaluation easier, the test is divided into two projects. The `front-end/` folder, containing a more general front-end setup, and `vue/` which contains a Vue.js SPA project generated with Vue CLI.

Expected total time to solve the assignments is 3 to 4 hours. Please read through the assignment descriptions before starting.

* [Front-end test assignment](./front-end)
* [Vue.js test assignment](./vue)
